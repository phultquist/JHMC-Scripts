# JHMC Scripts
Every year, IMSA runs [JHMC](https://students.imsa.edu/org/mao/jhmc.php).

**What's JHMC?** A math competition for middle schoolers.

## About
This code serves as a backup/public repository for the code written for JHMC. This code is essential for the competition, although I probably will barely update this repository.

## Usage
Code in `./Roster Registration` should be put in the roster registration spreadsheet that the Roster Registration Google Form backs up to.
Code in `./Name Tags`, as you might be able to guess, is for generating name tags from the link listed. There must be a template listed (first line).

### Special Note
I didn't write `./Roster Registration/checkLunch.gs` or `./Roster Registration/getRosterEntry.gs`, but they are still crucial.
