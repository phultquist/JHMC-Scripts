# JHMC Scripts
Every year, IMSA runs [JHMC](https://students.imsa.edu/org/mao/jhmc.php).

## About
This code serves as a backup/public repository for the code written for JHMC

## Usage
Code in `./Roster Registration` should be put in the roster registration spreadsheet that the Roster Registration Google Form backs up to.
Code in `./Name Tags`, as you might be able to guess, is for generating name tags from the link listed. There must be a template listed (first line).
